Grading

| | |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| 5%  | Piazza Discussion |
| 15% | Recitation Problem Sets |
| 20% | Homework |
| 30% | Midterm (15% each) |
| 30% | Final |

### Recitation Grading ###
Each recitation activity has multiple individual problems, each of which is graded using the following rubric:

| Score | Competency | Criteria |
|-------| -----------|---------|
| 5 | Perfect | 0 mistakes |
| 4 | Mostly Correct | 1 minor mistake |
| 3 | Somewhat Correct | 1 major mistake |
| 2 | Somewhat Incorrect | 2 major or 2 minor mistakes | 
| 1 | Mostly Incorrect | Understood the material |
| 0 | No Credit | Does not compile	 |

Total recitation grade = sum(individual problem grades) / 200

You may choose which problems to complete to obtain the 200 points, but the following criteria must be met:
  * You must attempt at least one activity from each recitation problem set. 
  * Failure to do so is a 25pt deduction per missing recitation.
  * You are allowed 2 absences. 
  * Being late (coming in more than 10 minutes after the class starts) 3 times equals 1 absences. 
  * Leaving early 3 times also equals one 1 absence. 
  * Any more than 2 absences is a 25pt deduction per absence.
If you obtain more than 200 points, the extra points will go towards extra credit provided that you've obtained a 4 or 5 on all submitted work, have submitted at least one problem from each recitaton, and have not been absent more than twice.

### Extra Credit ###
All the lectures and recitation activities and most of the in class coding samples are at https://github.com/story645/cs102 You can earn extra credit by filing an accepted bug report or by fixing an error and filing an accepted pull request.

Policies
========
### Email ###
Email should only be used to set up an in person meeting or inform me about needed accommodations unless I tell you otherwise. Any other emails may not receive a response. All coursework related communications should be done through piazza, which allows anonymous posting. If you are uncomfortable with this policy, come to speak to me.

### Piazza ###
We will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions to me, post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

Find our class page at: https://piazza.com/ccny.cuny/spring2015/csc10200/home 

Piazza Grade = [(.05*(days online+views)) + (.15*contributions)+(.15*questions) + (.30*notes) + (.35*answers)]

### Homework ###
* Homework must be submitted through Blackboard using the system discussed in class. 
* Homework submitted through other methods without prior approval  will not be graded.
* Questions about the homework should be asked on Piazza using the suggested format. 
* Emailed questions and questions not in that format may be ignored. 

### Attendence ###
* Missing the midterm or final (unexcused absences) will result in an F for the course.
* Send an email at least two weeks in advance about excused absences or exam conflicts.
* Provide documentation for any unexpected absence.

### Accessibility ###
* Have the accessibility center provide documentation for any accommodations ASAP
* Notify me that they've left documentation in my mailbox/etc.

### Plagiarism ###
* First plagerized assignment - 0 for the assignment
* Second plagerized assignment - 0 for all assignments
* Third plagerized assignment - 0 for the course
* Cheating on the midterms - automatic F on the course
* Cheating on the final - automatic F for the course

In the case of multiple similar homework submissions, plagerism on assignments is determined based on timestamps-the person who submitted first is assumed to be the originator and anyone else is assumed to have plagerized. All students who submit similar exam answers are assumed to be cheating.

Plagiarism is copying solutions from pretty much anywhere, including friends, solution manuals, and random websites. Plagiarism can result in various academic repercussions as described in the CCNY integrity policy: http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/current/integrity.cfm and any work suspected of being plagiarized will be dealt with per CCNY guidelines
